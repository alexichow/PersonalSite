				</div>
					<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_%28board_game%29">Breakthrough</a> is a game similar to Checkers with the variation that a
					piece may move across the board one space either forward or diagonally forward. A piece can only 'capture' an opponents piece in a diagonally-forward move.
					The first player to reach the other end of the board wins.</p>
					<div class="centered-text"><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="assets/img/bt.png"/></div>
					<p>My group of three created an artificial intelligence player that used multiple threads, alpha beta pruning, and an evaluation heuristic to determine the next best move. 
					The A.I. player would receive board state information and calculate its next move by using our scoring heuristic. A potential move was scored by evaluating a piece's distance from the end of the board,
					 if it could capture an opposing piece, and the number of remaining pieces for both sides after a capture occurred.<br>
					 <br>Contribution: I helped develop and implement the evaluation heuristic used by our player in the BreakThroughMove.java file, helped implement the alphaBeta() method of AlphaBetaBreakThroughPlayer.java 
					 and implemented the getMove() method of AlphaBetaBreakThroughPlayer.java which initially evaluates the game state for an immediate win condition and launches the threads for evaluating moves if a winning 
					 move is not found.<br></p><br>

					<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a> is a zero-player "game" that accepts user input for an initial state and then simulates cellular evolution
					according to the following set of rules:
					<ol>
						<li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.</li>
						<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
						<li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.</li>
						<li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
					</ol>
					<div class="centered-text"><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="assets/img/gol.png"></div>
					<br>My implementation makes use of Java's UI elements to create and display the board. Each cell is represented by an individual JPanel whose state is updated each generation 
					based on the above rules.<br>
					<br>My implementation has the following features:
					<ul>
						<li>Create an initial state by simply clicking on the 'cells' to mark them for life.</li>
						<li>Display the current generation.</li>
						<li>Start, stopping, resuming, and resetting during execution.</li>
						<li>Taking screenshots (Creates folder for current session to store screenshots) </li>
					</ul>
